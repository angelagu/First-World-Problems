At least you don't have ebola.
At least you don't have malaria.
At least you're not a teenage girl in India.
At least you weren't aborted.
At least you're not a child bride.
At least you weren't sold into slavery.
At least you don't live in North Korea.
At least your mother didn't cry because she couldn't feed you.
